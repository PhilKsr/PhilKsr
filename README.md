# Hey, I'm Philipp

Frontend Software Engineer. I build modern web applications that users love and businesses rely on.

## What I do

**Frontend engineering that scales.** React and Vue applications handling real user workflows. Modern component architectures, state management, performance optimization. Not just features - sustainable codebases that grow with your business.

**Full-stack when needed.** 4+ years across React, Vue, Node.js. I bridge frontend and backend - REST APIs, CI/CD pipelines, Docker deployments. If the user experience depends on it, I'll make it work.

**Structure that compounds.** I create workflows that stick. Self-organizing teams, clear processes, always keeping the bigger picture in focus. Technical excellence with hands-on problem solving.

**Adaptable by design.** Quick to pick up new frameworks - Angular, Java, PHP. I learn what the project needs. Frontend-first, but I understand the full stack.
